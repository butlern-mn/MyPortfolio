                    <h1>Overview:</h1>
                    <p>Wellness Spot - A Self-Care and Wellness Program for Bootcamp Participants. A New Website Design.</p>
                    <h1>Problem:</h1>
                    <p>Bootcamp students add a tremendous amount of intense stress to their lives, and many end up feeling overwhelmed, not fully connected to their cohort, and alone in the journey. There seems to be a missing piece from the bootcamp experience.</p>
                    <h1>Solution:</h1>
                    <p>A self-care and wellness program included in the bootcamp experience to assist bootcamp participants in navigating the huge life change process, intense stress, and overwhelm that can come with a bootcamp program. All with convenient and simple digital access.</p>
                    <h1>Role:</h1>
                    <p>UX/UI Designer on a team of four. My areas of contribution included: user research - survey development, user interviews - data analysis, user story development, ideation, wireframing, prototyping. And, front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), which was my largest solo contribution.</p>

                    <h1>Background:</h1>
                    <p>Our bootcamp cohort was in the home stretch. You could see the fatigue taking over people's demeanors. In the beginning, we were all energized, excited for what lay ahead, and reminded by our instructional staff that we had an intense 6 months ahead of us - take care of yourselves, set-up good habits from the beginning, etc...These pep talks dwindled over time.  Enter in a new Student Success Manager, Q. Q was energetic, abundantly positive, and reiterated how far we had come and how close we were to the the finish line.</p>
                    <p>Q joined in a class session to introduce himself, remind us he was there for any support we needed, and asking us "What do you need these last weeks?" The idea of self-care and our wellness crept back into the conversation. With the space opened up, people started stepping up and admitting they were OVERWHELMED and despite group work, felt a bit alone. Somedays it was hard to know where to start. And many had forgotten we even had a Student Success Manager. People indicated that a support factor felt like it was missing from the program.</p>
                    <p>Q wanted to address this - we weren't the only cohort he had heard this from. Q got a few people to meet with him outside of class to discuss what would be helpful and how could the program offer better support for self-care and overall wellness to participants. The next day he added a Wellness channel to our cohort's Slack and starting posting reminders about getting some self-care and mini-breaks into one's day. He posted photos and videos showing what he was doing for himself. People started following suite - posting and sharing things that worked for them in stressful times.</p>
                    <P>People started saying how they had learned more about their classmates and felt more connected to them in the first week alone, than in the past four months.</p>

                    <h1>User Research:</h1>
                    <p>After our group developed a proto-persona, we started our journey by compiling a survery for current and alumni bootcamp participants to gather quantitative data specific to the issue we saw and wanted to provide a solution for.</p>
                    <p>The survery was sent out to our current cohort and to alumni via collaboration with Q, our Student Success Manager, who was able to provide the survey link to other cohorts and alumni.</p>
                    
                    <h1>Survery Says:</h1>
                    <p>The quantitative results showed 81.6% of our fifty-nine respondents felt an increase in their stress during their boot camp.</p>
                    <p>The top two stressors reported were Time and Homework, which together accounted for 53% of the top five stressors.</p>
                    <p>And, 88% of respondents felt a wellness/self-care program would be beneficial.</p>
                    <p>From the surveys received, the team interviewed five current and former bootcamp participants to go more indepth about their bootcamp experience, did they think a wellness program within the bootcamp curriculum would be beneficial, and what types of resources do they think would be valuable.</p>

                    <p>An 'I Like, I Wish, What If' exercise was completed to generate ideas of redesign options that would be beneficial for Amelia.  With considerations to the length of the project, it was determined the scope of this redesign would include better global navigation layout, a filtration tool or categorization of resources and improved copy on the homepage, for inclusivity and organizational scope.</p>

                        <p>While working through the design process, style and brand for the website was discussed. Due to the nature of the services WRAP provides, it was determined that the esthetics of the site needed to be affirming, welcoming, inclusive, discreet, and accessible. It was determined better use of imagery to provide a sense of hope over anguish would be valuable as well as a redesign of the logo for more inclusivity. Considering usability testing feedback, and that purple is the representative color of domestic violence awareness, it was determined the branding colors would be kept, but the use would be more subtle and include gradients.</p>

                    <p>The initial lo-fi round of testing provided the team with valuable feedback.  User testing feedback was gathered and grouped to find themes and where iterations would provide the most positive experience for Amelia.</p>
                    <p>Feedback included positives such as:</p>
                    <ul class="listfont">
                        <li>The hotline number in the top navigation bar is easy to see/find</li>

                        <li>The homepage felt cluttered with the testimonial in the hero image</li>

                        <li>The categorization of the resources was a huge improvement, but suggestions for different titles for categories were provided</li>

                    <p>Key changes based on user testing included:</p>
                    <ul class="listfont">
                        <li>Moving the past client testimonial lower on the page</li>
